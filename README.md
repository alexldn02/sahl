# SAHL

## Super Abstract Hypertext Language

> A programmer-friendly hypertext markup language that compiles to HTML.

Let's be honest, nobody really likes HTML. For us it seemed to be a massive burden when it came to web development so we decided to create a language that allows one to glide through web development without tearing your hair out.

## Examples of HTML vs SAHL

```<h1>Example Title</h1>```
```h1 "Example Title"```

```<h1 style="color: #0000ff; float: left;">Example Title</h1>```
```h1(style: "color: #0000ff; float: left;") "Example Title"```
